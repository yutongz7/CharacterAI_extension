# CharacterAI Tool Extension Privacy Policy

## Intro

A browser extension used for research purposes that collects some chat history on Character.AI.

## Data Collection

The extension doesn't content any data at all. Since no data is collected, it stands to reason, and is, indeed, the case, that none of your data can be sold to third parties.

## Chrome Storage API

The extension take advantage of [Google Chrome's Storage API](https://developers.chrome.com/extensions/storage) to locally store minimal state information. This is similar to a [cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies). However, you can only download and access the data locally, and we will not store or access your data.


## Changes to the Privacy Policy

If there are substantive<sup>1</sup> changes made to this blanket privacy policy or to the individual privacy policies of the extensions, we will push out a new version of the affected extension(s) and ask you to agree to the amended privacy policy.

## Feedback

If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, feel free to [send me an email](yutongz7@stanford.edu).
